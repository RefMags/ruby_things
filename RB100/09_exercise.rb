# 1. Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.

   # assign the array to a variable and iterate over it/ initialize an array

num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

num.each {|num| puts "#{num}"}


# 2.Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.

num.each do |num|
  if num > 5
    puts "#{num}"
  else
    puts "#{num} is less than 5"
  end
end

num.each {|num| puts "#{num}" if num > 5 }

# 3. Now, using the same array from #2, use the select method to extract all odd numbers into a new array.


num2 = num.select { |num| num % 2 != 0 }
p num2


#4.  Append 11 to the end of the original array. Prepend 0 to the beginning.

num3 = num.push(11)
num4 = num.unshift(0)

p num3  # Why does 0 gets added to the array even though method doesnt call for it?

# 5. Get rid of 11. And append a 3.

num5 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
num6 = num5.pop(11).push(3)
p num6

# 6. Get rid of duplicates without specifically removing any one value.
num7 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 3]
num8 = num7.uniq
p num8

# 7. What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

# an array is a sequence of elements that can be accessed by indexed while.
# a hash contains a key value pair for referencing by key

# 8. Create a Hash, with one key-value pair, using both Ruby syntax styles.

# fruits = { :apple => 'green' }
# fruits = { apple: 'red' }

# 9. Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

# 1. Get the value of key `:b`.
# initialize the hash

h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
p h[:b]

# 2. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`

p h[:e] = 5

# 3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
h2 = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4, e:5}

h3 = h2.delete_if {|key, value| value < 3.5}
p h3

# 10. Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

# yes,
# hash values as array
h = {apples: ['green', 'red' , 'golden' , 'yellow', 'stripped', 'white']}

# array of hashes

arr = [{dog: 'busta'}, {dog: 'harry'}]

# 11. Given the following data structures, write a program that copies the information from the array into the empty hash that applies to the correct person.

contact_data = [["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
            ["sally@email.com", "404 Not Found Dr.", "123-234-3454"]]

contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}, "Sally Johnson" => {}}

#how do we access each element of the subarray
# how to do we populate the hash associated with each key in contacts hash

# how do we perform element assignment to a key valuein a hash


# Expected output:
#  {
#    "Joe Smith"=>{:email=>"joe@email.com", :address=>"123 Main st.", :phone=>"555-123-4567"},
#    "Sally Johnson"=>{:email=>"sally@email.com", :address=>"404 Not Found Dr.",  :phone=>"123-234-3454"}
#  }

# 12. Using the hash you created from the previous exercise, demonstrate how you would access Joe's email and Sally's phone number.

 contacts = {
   "Joe Smith"=>{:email=>"joe@email.com", :address=>"123 Main st.", :phone=>"555-123-4567"},
   "Sally Johnson"=>{:email=>"sally@email.com", :address=>"404 Not Found Dr.",  :phone=>"123-234-3454"}
 }

 p contacts["Joe Smith"][:email]
 p contacts["Sally Johnson"][:phone]

#  13. Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to delete all of the strings that begin with an "s" in the following array.

arr = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
arr2 = arr.delete_if { |element| element.to_s.start_with?('s') }
p arr2

# 14. Take the following array:

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

# and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.
