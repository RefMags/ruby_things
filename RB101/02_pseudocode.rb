# practicing pseudocode
# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a strig that is all those strings concatenated together
# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
  # every_other([1, 4, 7, 2, 5]) # => [1, 7, 5]
# 4. a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). if the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.
# 5. a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexex of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:
  # merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) # => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
